# 2D Geometry Constraint Solver

This is an open-source university learning project. Several algorithms will be implemented that aim to solve geometry
constraint problems in 2D. Due to the fact, that I develop this project for the purpose of learning it will have regular
,huge refactors and unstable approaches. Also I plan minimal testing and no CI/CD system or any kind of releases.

However, I'll try to keep to code clean and commented, also providing documentation. Feel free to use my code as a
starting point for your own projects.
